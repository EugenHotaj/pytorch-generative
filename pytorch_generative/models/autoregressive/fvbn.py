"""Implementation of the Fully Visible Belief Network (FVBN) [1].

The FVBN is an autoregressive model composed of a collection of linear models. Each
linear model tries to model p(x_i|x_{j<i}). The FVBN can be viewed as a special case of
MADE [2] with no hidden layers and one set of masks applied in raster-scan order.
