"""Implementation of the Beta-VAE [1] model.

Beta-VAE extends the vanilla VAE by introducing a scaling factor `Beta` for the KL 
Divergence term in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss. For priors with mutually 
independent factors, such as an Isotropic Gaussian, this has the effect of regularizing
the learned latent variables to be conditionally independent. The motivation is that 
independent latents will learn distangled representations of the dataset.
