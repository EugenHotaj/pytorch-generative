"""Implementation of the VQ-VAE [1] model.

The Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) extends the vanilla 
Variational Autoencoder by mapping the input to a discrete (instead of 
continuous) latent space. The discretization is performed using vector 
quantization where continuous outputs from an encoder are mapped to the nearest
vectors in a learned codebook. The main intuition behind using discretized
latents is that the underlying domain we are trying to model is usually 
discrete (e.g. words in a sentence, objects in an image, etc).
